# Taking deep uncertainty into account in traffic models: a case study of Groningen - Thesis Ilmo van Baarle

This is a readme for the thesis "Taking deep uncertainty into account in traffic models: a case study of Groningen", written by Ilmo van Baarle.
The goal of this research is to apply the RDM cycle to a traffic model written in PTV Visum. This needs a connection between the two programs.
With the help of this read me you will be able to better understand the code that is written.
At the end you should be able to conduct the same research.

## Installation

The main package that is used in the EMA_workbench. This library allows for an easy application of EMA research with many inherent analysis tools.
For further information on the package go to: https://emaworkbench.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
Another important package is the pypiwin32 library. This package allows Python and Visum to connect via a COM interface.

```
